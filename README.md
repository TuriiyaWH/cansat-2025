# cansat-2025
I worked on a CanSat project for the UK CanSat Competition, designing, building, and launching a satellite to collect atmospheric data. My role involved coding for the Raspberry Pi Pico, interfacing with sensors (BMP280, BNO055, GPS), handling telemetry, and contributing to data analysis and 3D animations.
